  <h2>The collections portal of the Black Metropolis Research Consortium
highlights archival materials across Chicago archives, museums, and community
organizations.</h2>

  <p>The Black Metropolis Research Consortium (BMRC) is a Chicago-based
membership association of libraries, universities, museums, community/arts
organizations, and other archival institutions. The BMRC’s mission is to
connect all who seek to document, share, understand and preserve Black
experiences. It is the vision of BMRC to be essential to promoting discovery,
preservation, and use of Black historical collections. Through consortial
programs, the BMRC aids in expanding broad access to its members’ holdings of
materials that document African American and African diasporic culture,
history, and politics, with a specific focus on materials relating to Chicago.
The BMRC is located at the University of Chicago, which serves as the Black
Metropolis Research Consortium’s host institution.</p>

  <p>Since its founding in 2006, the BMRC has complete two major archival
management projects making previously “hidden” collections available for
researchers, scholars, and artists. The Consortium believes that web-based
research tools provide an excellent opportunity for broadening access to unique
primary source materials held in its members’ collections.</p>

  <p>This enhanced and re-envisioned collections information portal brings
together four projects--two from the BMRC's work and two from the University of
Chicago. The BMRC <a
href="https://bmrc.lib.uchicago.edu/programs/survey-initiative/">Survey
Initiative</a> sought to discover materials about Black experiences held at a
variety of repositories in the Chicago area. Survey teams visited organizations
from 2009 to 2011, pored through collections, and wrote up basic information
about the collections they found, and creating the core of the BMRC collections
database. Building on this work with additional funding support from the Andrew
W. Mellon Foundation administered by the Council on Library and Information
Resources (CLIR), the <a
href="https://bmrc.lib.uchicago.edu/programs/color-curtain-processing-project/">Color
Curtain Processing Project</a> tackled the work of processing over 10,000
linear feet of materials and over 135 collections over a twenty-eight month
period, ending in 2013. The more comprehensive inventories and description of
these select collections was added to the database.</p>

  <p>To broaden the reach of the new Portal, two collections processing and
description projects at the BMRC's host institution, the University of Chicago,
were merged into the Portal. UNCAP, the Uncovering Chicago Archives Project
brought new visibility to archival collections held by a collaborative group of
Chicago institutions: the Chicago Defender newspaper, the DuSable Museum of
African-American History, the Vivian G. Harsh Research Collection of
Afro-American History and Literature of the Chicago Public Library,
Northwestern University, the South Side Community Art Center, and the
University of Chicago. Some of these organizations are members of the BMRC.
Though UNCAP wasn't focused on materials relevant to the African diaspora, many
of the collections processed and included in the project were within the scope
of the BMRC's portal. An earlier achival project launched by Jacqueline
Goldsby, then Associate Professor in English Language &amp; Literature and the
College of the University of Chicago, <a
href="http://mts.lib.uchicago.edu/">Mapping the Stacks</a>, was folded into the
UNCAP site. Both were also funded by the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation.</p>
